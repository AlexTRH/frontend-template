# Purpose of this repo

**This is a frontend template**, not a product app. Goal: interns and backend devs who don’t know frontend can start coding immediately and use it as a base for internal projects.

**Include in the template:**
- Correct architecture from day one (FSD), configs, example API layer, i18n
- **Design system / components** — use reference project (`comet-release`) as the base: same modals, buttons, forms, so internal projects share one look and feel
- **Concrete examples** — example page, entity, feature, form, API call so complete beginners have a ready skeleton to copy and adapt

**When generating code here:** follow architecture and component patterns from the reference project; use the universal stack (Zod, axios, etc.); keep structure and naming clear for newcomers. Prefer clarity and copy-paste-friendly examples over clever shortcuts.
